# This script automates the updating the "Projects" on PRs so that PR owners
# don't have to do it themselves. It's intended to run periodically on cron.
#
# It expects a JSON config file that specifies which users should map to which
# projects
#
# E.g.
#
#     {
#       "project_to_users_mapping": {
#         "Billing Team Project": ["abhchand", "mattRyan"],
#         "Some Other Project": ["mattRyan"]
#       }
#     }
#
# In the above case, any open PRs by `abhchand` will be assigned the Billing
# project and any open PRs by Matt Ryan will be assigned both projects.
#
# Ideally it would use the rich Github API but unfortunately Github has not
# exposed the ability to edit Projects on PRs. So we have to do this the hard
# way. This script utilizes a headless browser (Selenium Chrome) to go through
# and actually click the "Project" icon on each PR ðŸ˜²
#
# For this reason it requires valid Github credentials to log in and perform
# the update. Because of this terrible security restriction, this script is
# intended to run on your local machine or somewhere informal where your
# credentials can't be accidentally exposed.
#
# It looks for the following environment variables
#
#    - GITHUB_USERNAME - Your github username
#    - GITHUB_PASSWORD - Your github password
#    - GITHUB_OTP_SECRET - The `secret` query param of your otpauth token. This
#                          is needed to generate and fill out the 2FA auth
#    - * GITHUB_ORG_NAME - The organization name. Defaults to "callrail"
#    - * GITHUB_REPO_NAME - The repository name. Defaults to "callrail"
#
#   * optional
#
# The OTP (one-time password) auth token can be found in your otpauth URL that
# github provides when you set up 2FA. This is the URL that's encoded as a QR
# code that's scanned by apps like Google Authenticator or 1Password.
#
# e.g. otpauth://totp/GitHub:abhchand?secret=abcdefg&issuer=GitHub
#
# Here you'll need to set `GITHUB_OTP_SECRET` as `abcdefg`.
# If you use 1Password to store 2FA logins you can easily retrieve this URL.
# Otherwise you might have to disable and then re-enable your 2FA on Github
# to get a new QR code and then decode that QR code yourself.
